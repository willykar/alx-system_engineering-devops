The infrastructure consists of five servers:

1. Load Balancer 1 (HAproxy): This server is responsible distributing incoming traffic web servers. 
It a round-robin distribution algorithm, whichly distributes incoming traffic to each web server.
This ensures that no single web server is overwhelmed with traffic,
and also provides fault tolerance in case one of the web servers goes down.

2. Load Balancer 2 (HAproxy): This server is a secondary load balancer that is configured as a cluster with Load Balancer 1.This 
provides additional fault tolerance in case Load Balancer 1 goes down.

3. Web Server 1 (Nginx): This server is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests from the user's browser.
It serves static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

4. Web Server 2 (Nginx): This server is identical to Web Server 1 and provides additional capacity for handling
incoming traffic.

5. Application Server: This server is responsible for processing requests that require server-side processing.
It communicates with the database to retrieve or store data.

6. Database Primary Node (MySQL): This server is responsible for handling all write requests.

7. Database Replica Node (MySQL): This server is responsible for handling all read requests and periodically
synchronizes its data with the primary node to ensure data consistency.

Two additional servers are added to the infrastructure to provide additional capacity and fault
tolerance for the load balancer.

The components (web server, application server, and database) are
separated onto their own servers to reduce redundancy and optimize resource utilization.

Issues With This Infrastructure
1. High maintenance costs.
Moving each of the major components to its own server, means that more
servers would have to be bought and the company's electricity bill would rise along with the introduction of new servers.
Some of the company's funds would have to be used to buy the servers and pay for
the electricity consumption needed to keep the servers (including the new and old ones) running.
