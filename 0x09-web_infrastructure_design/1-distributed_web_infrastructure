Infrastructure Overview:

Load Balancer (HAproxy):
Function: Distributes incoming traffic to web servers using a round-robin distribution algorithm.
Configuration: Active-Active setup for fault tolerance.
Potential Issue: Single Point of Failure (SPOF) if the load balancer goes down.
Mitigation: Introduce redundancy with multiple load balancers.

Web Server 1 (Nginx):
Function: Handles incoming HTTP requests, serving static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Identical Configuration: Web Server 2 (Nginx) mirrors this setup.
Potential Issue: Increased load or failure on one server can impact performance.
Mitigation: Scaling infrastructure horizontally with additional web servers.

Application Server:
Function: Processes requests requiring server-side processing and interacts with the database.
Application Files: Contains code executed by the application server to fulfill requests.
Potential Issue: Increased load or failure can affect application performance.
Mitigation: Scaling horizontally by adding more application servers.

Database (MySQL):
Architecture: Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster.
Function: Stores and retrieves data, ensuring data consistency and availability.
Primary Node: Handles all write requests.
Replica Node: Handles read requests, periodically synchronizing data with the primary node.
Potential Issue: Single Point of Failure (SPOF) if primary node goes down.
Mitigation: Automatic failover mechanism to promote replica node in case of primary node failure.

Additional Concerns with the infrastructure:

Security:
Lack of Firewall: Leaves infrastructure vulnerable to attacks.
Absence of HTTPS: Traffic encryption is not implemented, risking data integrity and privacy.
Mitigation: Implement firewall rules to restrict access and deploy HTTPS to encrypt traffic.
Monitoring:

No monitoring tools in place to detect and address performance issues or failures.
Potential Issue: Lack of awareness regarding system health and performance.
Mitigation: Introduce monitoring solutions to track system metrics, detect anomalies,
and alert administrators for timely intervention.

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): While the use of a load balancer and multiple web servers 
reduces the risk of SPOF, there is still a risk of SPOF if the load balancer goes down.
To mitigate this, you can use redundancy by having multiple load balancers.
